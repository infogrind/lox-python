# lox-python

A Python version of the Lox interpreter from [Crafting
Interpreters](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58661468-crafting-interpreters)

This is just a personal project to get familiar wity Python and to learn new
interpreter techniques.

The recommended way to manage dependencies and run this is using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
